## November 2020

Culture:

- Reading Ian Dunt's [_How to be a liberal_](https://www.canburypress.com/products/how-to-be-a-liberal-by-ian-dunt-hardback-isbn9781912454419), which I'm enjoying greatly.

- Watching _Schitt's Creek_ with Katy and juggling _Gomorrah Season 3_, _Band of Brothers_ and
  _Dark Season 1_ on my own.

- Not started any new podcasts for a while --- am listening to old favourites like
  _Guardian: Today in Focus_, _Athletico Mince_, _Desert Island Discs_ and _The
  Economist_.

- Still working my way through _Red Dead Redemption_ on an old Xbox 360. Looking
  forward to getting a Series X later this year and playing something more
  modern than 2010.

Life:

- Gutted that the second UK lockdown is forcing [Stronghold](https://www.thestrongholduk.com/) to close its doors for an unknown period.
